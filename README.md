# landing-page

This file contains all the code I worked on for the Odin Project's Landing Page project as part of the last part of CSS/Flexbox section of the Foundations course. 

I hope to come back to it in the future and make it my own webpage, as well as make it responsive as I continue to learn about JavaScript. 

Hope you enjoy!
